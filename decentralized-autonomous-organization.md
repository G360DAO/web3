# Decentralized Autonomous Organization

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is a community that enables a distributed group of people to organize or achieve a mission through a shared set of rules enforced on a blockchain. The DAO is created and defined by smart contracts which contain the rules and actions of the organization.

One of the core benefits of a DAO is that they are more transparent than traditional companies since all actions and funding in the DAO are viewable by anyone on the blockchain. This significantly reduces the risk of corruption and censorship. Publicly traded companies must provide independently audited financial statements, but shareholders only get to see a snapshot of the financial health of the organization. Since a DAO's balance sheet exists on a public blockchain, it is always completely transparent, down to every single transaction.

DAOs are globally accessible and have lower barriers to entry than companies, as anyone willing to participate can do so.

Traditional (centralized leadership) companies consist of a top-down (management) hierarchy making all the decisions. Instead, in a DAO the decisions are made by any member of the community, as in every token holder. Anyone that has an interest in the mission of the DAO, be it a developer or a token investor can submit their vote for new change proposals. As everyone is rewarded for their participation, no matter at what layer, everyone will strive to make the right decisions for the future of the community. The more the community succeeds, the higher the rewards for all participants.

This makes rewards for your contributions to the community fairer than in a traditional company structured system. The more you contribute to the community, the higher your rewards.

In a DAO there is no need for CEOs, presidents, or even a HR department, as everything is managed by the community itself. In a true DAO, this would even mean that there are no salary negotiations, as everyone is valued and rewarded for their actual contributions. Simply put, you don’t contribute, you don’t get the rewards.

Once a DAO evolves, it will increase the value of the used token. This will also make it more attractive for potential investors. Everyone involved in the DAO has the same vision, goals, and incentives to succeed.
