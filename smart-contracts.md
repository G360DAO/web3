# Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a computer program that is run on the blockchain (i.e. Ethereum). It can store both functions (bits of code that do things) and data (information). Smart contracts are often compared to vending machines. If you put in specific inputs, you get specific outputs. If I walk up to a vending machine, insert $1, and press the “orange soda” button, then I’ll get an orange soda if there’s any left in the machine. If there’s no more orange sodas, I’ll get my dollar back.

Smart contracts work the same way, people can interact with them by sending information with the expectation of receiving specific results or information. Just like the vending machine doesn’t have a little person inside handing out sodas, smart contracts are automatic (dare we say, autonomous).
