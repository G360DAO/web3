# Back to the internet roots

Once upon a time, the internet was still in its infancy and it was run by and for innovative hackers and technical enthusiasts alike. The hacking communities spun up all over the internet and people were in it for the knowledge, skills and sharing of information. Unfortunately - as you probably know - with the commercialization of the internet also came the incentives for bad actors to illegitimately profit from corporations and individuals, which ultimately changed the cyberspace landscape. Although communities for (legitimate) hackers still exist, they are either very small and scattered all over, or don't share the same ideals to collaborate together in creating a more secure internet. Many of the people have moved on to work for big corporations to fight the bad actors, which for the younger crowd is all they've ever known in the security space, apart from maybe attending Black Hat or Defcon.

With the G360DAO we will become _the_ community that not only works towards making the internet a more secure place and members like you get rewarded in tokens for their work (as mentioned in the [whitepaper](https://app.gitbook.com/o/2YkrRUxPFdNDfr8LQAiG/s/hmXrG47OL0trMvj7QZzb/)), but also work together on cool new interesting security and privacy insights. While at the same time making it possible to share knowledge, ideas and teach each other the necessary skills required to do so. Just like the internet was originally envisioned!

This will all happen in an environment with cool and interesting people that really breathe security, privacy, hacking, development and Web3. To get a grasp of cool stuff we will do and relate to:

* The following keywords make us all warm and fuzzy: "exploits", "vulnerabilities", "credentials", "ATT\&CK", "ransomware", "blockchain", "web3", “privacy”
* Community members with "1337" hacker aliases instead of boring real names
* Stunt hacks with real societal impact
* Hacking competitions
* Hackathons
* Community events and meetups (discuss your ideas over a couple of Club Mates!)
* Hacker merchandise
* Cool hacker titles instead of the boring traditional "security engineer" or "developer"
* Remote working; wherever, whenever
* Discord communities to discuss all your adventures, findings, obstacles, whether related to security or not
* Building your Web3 resume
* Earn 1337 NFT batches
* Bug bounties
* Code2earn, Hack2earn

**If you are still interested after reading all the awesome incentives above and you are a hacker, developer or security specialist? Join the revolution!**

Do you believe in building a like-minded security community that should be rewarded for their contributions? Do you believe your voice in security decisions needs to be heard? Do you believe we as a community should work on raising the bar for security in general with real solutions? If you are screaming _**yes**_ to all those questions and are you a hacker, security engineer, developer, or think you can contribute in any way, shape or form, then we welcome you to join the G360DAO mission via Discord ([https://discord.gg/Gt8P9AdQTM](https://discord.gg/Gt8P9AdQTM)) and Telegram ([https://t.me/+GIDEX\_Xgz3djYTRk](https://t.me/+GIDEX\_Xgz3djYTRk))!
