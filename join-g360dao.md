# Join G360DAO!

We are still in the early stages of our new journey. There are loads of challenges ahead and many things we need to learn. We expect to make (a lot of!) mistakes, but by being dedicated to the mission and vision, we will conquer these hurdles _**together!**_We really want to embrace this journey together with a community to shape the G360DAO organisation of the future! Only as the G360DAO will we be able to raise the security bar!

Do you believe in building a like-minded security community that should be rewarded for their contributions?Do you believe your voice in security decisions needs to be heard?Do you believe we as a community should work on raising the bar for security in general with real solutions?If you are screaming _**yes**_ to all those questions and are you a hacker, security engineer, developer, or think you can contribute in any way, shape or form, then we welcome you to join the G360DAO mission via Discord ([https://discord.gg/Gt8P9AdQTM](https://discord.gg/Gt8P9AdQTM)) and Telegram ([https://t.me/+GIDEX\_Xgz3djYTRk](https://t.me/+GIDEX\_Xgz3djYTRk))!

Do you feel, as we do, that justice on the digital infrastructure really needs to be raised and do you want to provide us with the resources to work on real Information Security solutions?Then buy one or more G360DAO NFTs! By buying these NFTs you will ensure that G360DAO will have working capital to develop smart contracts, set up the legal structure, take care of everything around taxes and all other practical matters required to get started.Once G360DAO starts generating revenue we will share a capped portion of this revenue with the NFT token holders. However, this may take quite some time.​[Subscribe to the G360DAO NFT waiting list!](https://guardian360.activehosted.com/f/85)​

For investors we will mint investment tokens.As described in the Tokenomics section, these investment tokens will be eligible for voting. Once G360DAO starts generating revenue we will share a portion of this revenue with the investment token holders.The investment tokens will initially be sold in a private sale and eventually we will look at the option of having the investment tokens listed on a public exchange.​[Details can be found on Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/2YkrRUxPFdNDfr8LQAiG/s/QZ3ahML7tpbcBqNJehsq/).

### **Know your customer - screening** <a href="#know-your-customer-screening" id="know-your-customer-screening"></a>

In order to be eligible for investment (both as regular investor of for NFTs), a Know Your Customer (KYC) screening will be mandatory for regulatory reasons. Once you cleared the KYC, you will be whitelisted and you can receive the tokens (investment or NFTs) bought.
