# Why its time to join the G360 DAO and Web3

In our opinion it will only be possible to \*really\* achieve the community as described in the last chapter by embracing a decentralized Web3 world. If you would like to read more about Web3 we encourage you to read the “History of the Web” chapter.

### History of the Web

Way back in the 1990s when the world wide web was invented, the web mostly consisted of static pages. These static pages offered nothing more than an information consumption model. This era of the web is now referred to as Web 1.0 (or Web1 in short).

Since around 2004 it became more apparent that web pages should be more dynamic in nature. This would enrich websites with user generated content, based on their unique actions and preferences. This ultimately led to companies like Google and Facebook offering services on this user generated content, where advertisements served as the business model. In those cases, the end user became the actual product. Other Web2 examples are social media, e-commerce, and knowledge platforms. Web2 brought producers and consumers closer to each other, making it possible to interact peer-to-peer on a global scale.

There is, however, always a trusted intermediary between the producer and consumer. Companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are very centralized, and people are dependent on these companies for all their interactions. This gives these companies a lot of power and control over their users and their data as they ultimately dictate all the rules and can charge high fees for usage of their platform.

In recent years the power of these central companies has resulted in a lot of debates on privacy, censorship, and inequality.

Amazon comes to mind, where only a few people benefit from the company’s tremendous growth and other people are working in non-favorable working situations to put it mildly.

Web3 attempts to change the whole trajectory of how the web and therefore its interactions will operate. The focus will be shifted to decentralization, where everyone can participate and be compensated for their contributions in tokens. So instead of a centralized top-down structure which makes the decisions, the control of the organization is delegated to “the people” in the form of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

This DAO will be made possible by using blockchain technologies. We will go into further details about DAOs in the following sections.

Whereas the Web2 movement was mostly on the frontend of the web, Web3 is more focused on what’s going on behind the scenes, or rather the backend. For example, even though an end user will still visit a website, all the interactions with people are truly peer-to-peer without the intermediary trusted company in-between.

In many cases, a Web3 platform is built as a dAPP (decentralized application), where the site/application itself and the underlying infrastructure is decentralized using blockchain and decentralized storage options. This would even remove the dependency of the centralized cloud providers such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft in the end as the blockchains can run on any internet infrastructure (even using your own home internet connection).

The core concepts of Web3 are:

* Trustless no intermediary party needed
* Permissionless anyone can join, contribute, participate
* Verifiable everything is transparent and recorded on the blockchain
* Self-governing the community makes the decisions
* Decentralized distributed and robust
